# Intro

I am the fresh graduate from the Griffith University, having completed my Master of Information Technology (Software Development and Support), December, 2023.

# Some history

- At the age of 8, I discovered my passion for sports, particularly cricket. Representing my school and university teams, I dedicated nine years of my life to playing professional cricket. The thrill of the game and the camaraderie with my teammates created unforgettable memories that shaped my early years.

- In school, my love for physics and mathematics fueled my curiosity. The challenges and puzzles presented by these subjects intrigued me, laying the foundation for my academic journey. Consequently, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, driven by a desire to explore the principles that govern the physical world.

- Fast forward to the present, my journey has taken an unexpected turn. After years on the cricket field and diving into the world of mechanical engineering, I discovered a newfound passion for Information Technology (IT). Intrigued by the dynamic nature of the IT landscape and its potential to transform industries, I made the bold decision to pursue a Master's in Information Technology with a focus on software development.

- This shift reflects my evolving interests and the recognition that the future lies in the digital realm. Embracing the challenge of mastering software development, I am eager to leverage my diverse background to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of Information Technology.

The rugged terrains of the Himalayas, with their breathtaking vistas, have become the backdrop to many unforgettable adventures.
